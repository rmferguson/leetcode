    "# 2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "[2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-punishment-number-of-an-integer/description/) is a leetcode problem with one of the most threatening names I've ever seen. The malicious aura here is palpable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also hate it. It has one of the magic tricks that I often malign. But let's take a look at the problem before I get more editorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a positive integer `n`, return the punishment number of `n`.\n",
    "> The punishment number of `n` is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:\n",
    ">    - 1 <= i <= n\n",
    ">    - The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example 1:\n",
    "> Input: `n = 10`\n",
    "> Output: 182\n",
    "> Explanation: There are exactly 3 integers `i` in the range [1, 10] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:\n",
    "> - 1 since 1 * 1 = 1\n",
    "> - 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1 with a sum equal to 8 + 1 == 9.\n",
    "> - 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 and 0 with a sum equal to 10 + 0 == 10.\n",
    "> Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example 2:\n",
    "> Input: `n = 37`\n",
    "> Output: 1478\n",
    "> Explanation: There are exactly 4 integers `i` in the range [1, 37] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:\n",
    "> - 1 since 1 * 1 = 1. \n",
    "> - 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1. \n",
    "> - 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0. \n",
    "> - 36 since 36 * 36 = 1296 and 1296 can be partitioned into 1 + 29 + 6.\n",
    "> Hence, the punishment number of 37 is 1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Constraints:\n",
    ">    1 <= n <= 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "From here it should be clear why I hate this problem. That's right: whoever wrote the examples used the word \"Hence\" like they're better than you.\n",
    "\n",
    "But also because I maintain that any coding question that could have an OEIS page is a bad interview problem. Like [Fibonacci Numbers](https://oeis.org/A000045). If you got asked to do Fibonacci Numbers in an interview, you'd laugh, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "But at any rate, this is a 2 part problem:\n",
    "1. Find all the numbers `i` between 1 and `n` that qualify.\n",
    "2. Square all qualified numbers and return the sum. (e.g. 1+81+100 = 182)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also note that Example 2 was chosen very deliberately. It's *almost* the next number after 10 where the punishment number is any bigger, which would have been 36. That's right, all pn(n) where 10 < n < 36, pn(n) = 182.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the constraints, it seems to be mostly because square numbers can get away from you. 10,000<sup>2</sup> would add another 2 zeroes and 100,000<sup>2</sup> would no longer fit in a 32 bit integer.\n",
    "\n",

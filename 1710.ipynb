    "[Leetcode 1710 Maximum Units on a Truck](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/description/) is one of the problems on the [Amazon Questions List](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/7p5x763/?sorting=W3sic29ydE9yZGVyIjoiREVTQ0VORElORyIsIm9yZGVyQnkiOiJGUkVRVUVOQ1kifV0%3D&page=1)\n",

    "> You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You are given a 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes<sub>i</sub >= [numberOfBoxes<sub>i</sub>, numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub>i</sub>]:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - numberOfBoxes<sub>i</sub> is the number of boxes of type i.\n",
    "> - numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub>i</sub> is the number of units in each box of the type i.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize.\n",
    ">\n",

    "The box types and the number of boxes are both relatively small, clocking it at less than 1000 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truck size is slightly large, at 100_000 or less, so we'll call that medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also make the observation that any individual box can contain any number of units and doesn't take up additional space. It's still just a box, and we're only concerned about the number of boxes. Intuitively, a 12\"x12\"x12\" box full of books isn't any larger than a 12\"x12\"x12\" box of chocolate, even if the latter is far tastier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question: Do we just take as many of the biggest box as we can every time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "> Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Output: 8\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Explanation: There are:\n",
    "> - 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.\n",
    "> - 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.\n",
    "> - 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.\n",
    "> You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.\n",
    "> The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "That all makes sense and they also showed their work by showing the numberOfUnitsPerBox going in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "So working through Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10\n",
    "> - Only way to get to 91 would be to take the 50 from the 5 boxes of 10.\n",
    "> - Then take 27 from the 3 boxes of 9 (77 in 8 boxes) \n",
    "> - Then take 2 boxes of 7 for 14 (91 in 10 boxes)\n",
    "> - (5 * 10) + (3 * 9) + (2 * 7) => 50 + 27 + 14\n",
    ">Output: 91\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm how about that they took from the biggest boxes in decending order again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: **Yes**, take the biggest box every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so how do we get the biggest box?\n",

# leetcode
A collection of notebooks going over leetcode answers.

These are intended to be guides for how to think about the problems and then answer them, frequently getting a little absurd with it.

If you don't want to download a notebook yourself, I highly recommend [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/)

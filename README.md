# leetcode
A collection of notebooks going over leetcode answers.

These are intended to be guides for how to think about the problems and then answer them, frequently getting a little absurd with it.

You can, and probably should, download the notebooks and play the examples. Run them on your machine to see how the timings differ.

If you don't want to download a notebook yourself, I highly recommend [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/)

Did I miss something? Is there a typo on my explanation? Feel free to make a Pull Request or reach out to me and I'll get it fixed.
